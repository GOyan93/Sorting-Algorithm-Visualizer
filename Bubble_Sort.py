"""
The bubble sort algorithm will be used within a sorting visualizer.
This algorithm will take a list of numbers and will interate over the list 
bringing the highest value to the end of the list after each iteration.
The tests for this algorithm will use end cases involving the '0' integer, 
negative integers floating point numericals, and other inputs.
